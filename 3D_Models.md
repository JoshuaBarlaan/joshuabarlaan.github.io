## Tube

### Assembled Model
<model-viewer src="tube/tube_glb_files/tube.glb"
              alt="A 3D model of a tube"
              auto-rotate
              camera-controls></model-viewer>

### Model Part 1 - Bottom

<model-viewer src="tube/tube_glb_files/tube_bottom.glb"
              alt="A 3D model of a tube"
              auto-rotate
              camera-controls></model-viewer>

### Model Part 2 - Middle

<model-viewer src="tube/tube_glb_files/tube_middle.glb"
              alt="A 3D model of a tube"
              auto-rotate
              camera-controls></model-viewer>

### Model Part 3 - Cap

<model-viewer src="tube/tube_glb_files/tube_cap.glb"
              alt="A 3D model of a tube"
              auto-rotate
              camera-controls></model-viewer>

### Assembly Instructions and notes
-Print at least 1 copy of bottom, and cap.  
-This will create a tube of internal length of about 135mm  
-by adding the Middle part to the tube will add about 125mm to this length. 
-You are able to add as many Middle parts though the stability will be in question. 
-The example model has 2 copies of the middle part.  
-The design has friction fit in mind. But gluing the parts together is recommended.
-Use of any Adhesive such as super glue. 
-For my use case, Hot-melt Adhesive/hot glue is enough.
-the model having multiple parts allows the user to customize where the model opens.
	-such as having it open at the top by ungluing the cap or somewhere in the middle.
